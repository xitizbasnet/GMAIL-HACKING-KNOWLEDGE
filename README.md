GMAIL HACKING KNOWLEDGE

- Understand the process
Whenever someone logs into Gmail (or any other login service), a file called a "cookie" is sent to their computer. This cookie allows the user to stay logged in, even if  they leave Gmail. A packet sniffer can find cookies being transferred over a wireless network. When you find a Gmail cookie, you can open it on your computer and potentially access your target's inbox. You'll need to be connected to the same wireless network as your target

- Download and install Wireshark

 Wireshark is a free network monitoring utility that you can download from wireshark.org. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Installing Wireshark is a straightforward process. Follow the prompts like you would with most programs

- Download Cookie Cadger
 
This is a Java program that will will find and intercept cookies being sent across the wireless network. Cookie Cadger doesn't need to be installed. It works the same in every operating system


-Connect to the same wireless network your target is connected to

You will need to be connected to the same wireless network as your target. This means you'll need to be close


- Launch Wireshark

Wireshark will need to be running in order for Cookie Cadger to work


-Run Cookie Cadger and select your wireless adapter

Select the adapter connected to the wireless network from the drop-down menu. You should see the main frame populate with unsecured cookies from other people using the network

- Use the domain filter to find Google cookies

The second column will display a list of domains that Cookie Cadger is finding cookies for. Look for Google domains, particularly mail.google.com

-Click "Replay This Request" when you've found a Gmail cookie

This will load the cookie into your own web browser. The right cookie will take you directly to the target's inbox.
Goodluck !
